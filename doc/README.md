# Generate API Documentation
### Steps
* To install YARD Run 

`$ gem install yard`

* There's a possible chance your Ruby install lacks RDoc, which is occasionally used by YARD to convert markup to HTML. If RDoc not installed, install by issuing:
* `$ apt-get install rdoc`

* `$ yardoc`

* This will generate HTML documentation in **doc** directory.
* Open **index.html** in **doc** directory.
