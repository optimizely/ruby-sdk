    # Optimizely's decision service that determines into which variation of an experiment a user will be allocated.

    # This includes all of the following (in order):
    #
    # 1. Check experiment status
    # 2. Check forced bucketing
    # 3. Check whitelisting
    # 4. Check user profile service for past bucketing decisions (sticky bucketing)
    # 5. Check audience targeting
    # 6. Use Murmurhash3 to bucket the user
