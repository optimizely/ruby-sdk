  class DecisionService
    # Optimizely's decision service that determines into which variation of an experiment a user will be allocated.
    #
    # The decision service contains all logic relating to how a user bucketing decisions is made.
    # This includes all of the following (in order):
    #
    # 1. Checking experiment status
    # 2. Checking whitelisting
    # 3. Checking user profile service for past bucketing decisions (sticky bucketing)
    # 3. Checking audience targeting
    # 4. Using Murmurhash3 to bucket the user
